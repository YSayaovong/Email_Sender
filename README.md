# Python Email Automation Tool

## What I Did
I created a Python-based tool to automate email sending using the SMTP protocol. The tool allows users to customize recipients, subjects, and body content.

## Why I Did This Project
I wanted to explore automation workflows and learn how to integrate Python with real-world email protocols for productivity enhancements.

## What I Accomplished
- Built a functional email-sending script.
- Gained hands-on experience with the `smtplib` library and email security protocols.
- Enhanced my skills in developing automation tools.
