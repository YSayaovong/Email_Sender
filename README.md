# Email_Sender

In this project, I developed a simple Python program that automates the process of sending emails. The program allows users to input the recipient's email address, subject, and message content, making it easy to send personalized emails with just a few lines of code.

I utilized Python's built-in libraries to handle email sending securely and efficiently. Please note that for privacy and security reasons, I have omitted my personal email addresses and passwords in this project. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential while demonstrating the functionality of the email-sending process.
